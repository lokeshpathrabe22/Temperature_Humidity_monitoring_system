# Temperature_Humidity_monitoring_system
This IoT project monitors Humidity and Temperature over the internet using ThingSpeak where the current Humidity &amp; Temperature data is monitored over the Internet using the ThingSpeak server. It is accomplished by the data communications between Arduino, DHT11 Sensor Module, ESP8266 WIFI module. The values of temperature and humidity are also displayed on LCD display. Programmed Arduino gather data from DHT11 sensor and send to ThingSpeak server using ESP8266 WIFI module.

Abstract:
At the present time, as it is obvious, the global warming has negative impacts on environments so, both humidity and temperature constitute the main factors that should be considered in design of modern weather stations. The highly demanded weather station are characterized with high efficiency, compacted size, portable (In order to measure remote areas), and low power consuming. In contrary to the traditional bulky and high-power consuming weather station. The prediction of climate in general and weather in particular are of paramount importance, especially with the possible negative consequences that may occur. Therefore, it is necessary to design an affordable, compacted size, and feasible weather station that provides significant information concerning humidity and temperature. This project employed a highly reliable DHT11 sensor and ESP8266 for transmitting and receiving data. The DHT11 sensor is very accurate regarding humidity and temperature measurement whereas ESP8266 processes high data rate, better range, and portability. This project involves a system, with low cost and high performance, to provide accurate measurement of humidity and temperature and then transmits the data to display in LCD screen and to the Thingspeak server using Internet.

Aim of Project:
Live Temperature and Humidity Monitoring over Internet using Arduino and ThingSpeak. It is accomplished by the data communications between Arduino, DHT11 Sensor Module, ESP8266 WIFI module and LCD.
